# Gesture Control Game

Welcome to the **Gesture Control Game** project documentation! This project allows you to control popular mobile games like **Subway Surfers** and **Temple Run** using **body posture** and **hand gestures**. By leveraging **Mediapipe** and **OpenCV**, this application translates your body and hand movements into in-game actions, providing an immersive and hands-free gaming experience.

## Why This Project is Useful

This project demonstrates how computer vision can be used to create innovative, interactive experiences. It is particularly useful for:

- Gamers who want to explore new ways of interacting with their favorite games.
- Developers interested in learning about gesture recognition and real-time pose detection.
- Educators or researchers exploring applications of computer vision in human-computer interaction.

## Key Features

- **Hands-Free Gaming**: Play games without touching a keyboard, mouse, or controllerâ€”just use your body or hand gestures.
- **Real-Time Gesture Detection**: Detect and translate gestures into game actions with minimal latency using **Mediapipe** and **OpenCV**.
- **Customizable Gestures**: Supports both **body posture** (e.g., leaning, crouching) and **hand gestures** (e.g., thumbs up, hand movement) for controlling games.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works with popular games like **Subway Surfers** and **Temple Run**, making it versatile and fun to use.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Displays frames per second (FPS) to help optimize performance and ensure smooth gameplay.
- **Easy Integration**: Includes an API for advanced users to integrate gesture control into other applications or games.
